Goroutines and Channels Problem Statement:

1. Given a string containing conversation between alice and bob,
In the string, if it reaches $, it means end of alice message,
and if it reaches #, it means end of bob's message, 
and if it reaches ^, it means end of conversation ignore string after that.

Note: given string doesn't contain any spaces. If message contains two continuous conversations from one person it should be printed one after another as given in the example. 

write a program to separate out messages from alice and bob. Write messages from alice and bob on seperate channels, whenever a message from alice/bob, print it in front of their name as shown in the example below:

Note: there is a single space before and after colon(:) and no space before and after comma.

e.g: "helloBob$helloalice#howareyou?#Iamgood.howareyou?$^"
output: alice : helloBob,bob : helloalice,bob : howareyou?,alice : Iamgood.howareyou?

2. Given a string, reverse it using one go routine.And inside go routine print reversed string and number of goroutines launched

e.g: Input: test123 output: 321tset 2

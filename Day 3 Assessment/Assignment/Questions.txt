2. What's The Day
Write a program to store the day(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) against the respective index of the day(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in a map.
You can hard-code the map in your program.
Take an integer input from the user and print the day stored against that index and if nothing is to be found for that index,
Print "Not a day"
Hint: Following code can be used to take an integer input from the user in the GO Programming Language

3. Word Count
Write a Program to fulfil the following conditions.
Input: A string containing words separated by space
Output: A slice containing words with the highest frequency in the input string.
Note: The order of the words in the resultant slice should be the same as the order they appear in the input string.
Condition: Words are case-sensitive. Joe is not the same as joe.
Given Code Template: A code template is provided that takes a string as an input and turns it into a slice of strings.

4. Return the slices
Complete the program to return 3 slices of a given array, based on the following conditions.
Given Array : ["qwe", "wer", "ert", "rty", "tyu", "yui", "uio", "iop"]
Hint: Hard-code the given array into your program.

Input: Two space-separated integers representing index1 and index2.
Output: Output will contain 3 slices
1. slice containing all the elements from the start of the array to Index1
2. slice containing all the elements from index1 to index2
3. slice containing all the elements from index2 to the end of the array
Conditions to Handle:
If Either of the input indexes is out of range of the given array, print "Incorrect Indexes" and exit the program

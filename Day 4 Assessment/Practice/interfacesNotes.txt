Interfaces are basically behavioral type, it just says that any struct that follows the behavior(methods) defined in the interface is a part of the interface.
--> the type of the interface can be defined using: 

	
type geometry interface {
    area() float64
    perim() float64
}

type circle struct {
    radius float64
}

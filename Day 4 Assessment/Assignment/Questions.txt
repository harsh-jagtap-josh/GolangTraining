Assignment for the day:
1. The given program accepts an integer value between 1 to 4 from the user.
There is an option associated with each value, which is basically objects of different data types with some associated value.

Write a method named "AcceptAnything" which takes any type of data as input.

Based on the option chosen by the user, we will send different types of objects to this function and it should print the following based on its respective data type of value sent to the function "AcceptAnything".

integer :
"This is a value of type Integer, <value>"

string :
"This is a value of type String, <value>"

boolean :
"This is a value of type Boolean, <value>"

Custom data type Hello :
"This is a value of type Hello, <value>"

2. The given program accepts 2 values from the user, length and breadth of a rectangle respectively.

Complete the program by writing methods "Area" and "Perimeter" on Rectangle type to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Hint:
Method Signatures for Area and Perimeter
Area() int
Perimeter() int

Formulae:
Area = length * width
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Example Test Case 1:
Input: 10 20
Output:
Area of Rectangle: 200
Perimeter of Rectangle: 60

3. The given program takes an integer value as input from the user i.e 1 or 2.
Option 1 represents Rectangle and Option 2 represents Square.

Given the metrics of the shapes are hard-coded, complete the given program to achieve the following:

1. Create an interface Quadrilateral which has the following method signatures
Area() int
Perimeter() int

2. Implement the Quadrilateral interface for the given shapes i.e Rectangle and Square

3. Define a "Print" function which accepts any shape that implements Quadrilateral interface and Prints Area and Perimeter of shape in the following manner:

"Area :  <value>"
"Perimeter :  <value>"


HINT: Step 2 means, to define methods in Quadrilateral interface for given shapes


Formulae:

Area of Rectangle: length * width
Perimeter of Rectangle: 2*(length + breadth)


Area of Square: side * side
Perimeter of Square: 4 * side
